# Troubleshooting
I am trying to tick the box but it doesnt work. Check
1. You have correct system date
2. Not running http sniffers (wireshark, fiddler, some AV). I am using KIS and its fine here
3. Wont work in first month of new league
4. ExileAPI Loader.exe is not blocked in firewall
5. Running windows 10 x64

Kicked for performing too many actions ?
I use global 40-60 ms delay after every action but maybe I missed smth. Try predictive mode in PoE
